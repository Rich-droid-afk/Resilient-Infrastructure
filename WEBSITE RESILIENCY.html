            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>Civil engineers play a key role in designing infrastructures that can adapt to the growing threats of climate change, protecting both people and the economy.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="objective">
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Promote Policies for Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Design: Advocate for the adoption of policies that require the integration of climate-resilient designs in all new infrastructure projects, including buildings, bridges, roads, and utilities.</li>
                <li>Incorporate Climate Change Projections into Infrastructure Planning: Advocate for legislation that mandates the inclusion of future climate change scenarios and risk assessments in infrastructure planning and development.</li>
                <li>Develop and Enforce Updated Building Codes and Standards: Lobby for stricter building codes and infrastructure standards that address climate risks, including higher elevation requirements in flood-prone zones, hurricane-resistant structures, and heat-tolerant materials.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="impact">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>As the world increasingly faces the challenges posed by climate change, the need for resilient infrastructure has become more urgent. Advocacy for resilient infrastructure is crucial, as it involves pushing for policies, funding, and awareness to ensure infrastructure is designed and built to cope with the evolving environmental landscape.</p>
            <p>One of the most immediate and critical impacts of advocating for resilient infrastructure is improved public safety. As climate change continues to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, communities are at greater risk from floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and heatwaves. Infrastructure that is not designed to cope with these stresses can lead to catastrophic failures, resulting in loss of life, displacement of populations, and widespread destruction.</p>
